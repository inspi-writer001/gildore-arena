# Project: Switched

<!-- cspell:ignore livestreaming Turbopack webrtc solana -->

## What This Is

Switched is a browser-based live streaming platform that combines a professional stream studio (like StreamYard) with a viewer community platform (like Twitch/Kick). Creators go live directly from their browser, invite guests via shareable links, choose from preset stream layouts, and simulcast to YouTube, X, and LinkedIn — all from a single tab. The platform is built creator-first with a roadmap toward a blockchain-based token economy on Solana.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components**: shadcn/ui (base-vega style, dark theme)
- **Icons**: lucide-react
- **Backend / Database / Real-time**: Convex
- **Auth**: Convex Auth (Google OAuth)
- **Client Data Fetching**: TanStack Query v5
- **Studio WebRTC**: Cloudflare Realtime SFU
- **Stream Delivery**: Cloudflare Stream (HLS)
- **Simulcast**: Restream API
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Project Structure

- `app/` — Pages, layouts, and route handlers (Next.js App Router)
- `app/ui/` — shadcn-generated UI primitives (do not edit directly)
- `components/` — Feature components and shared UI built on top of shadcn primitives
- `hooks/` — Custom React hooks
- `lib/` — Utility functions, Convex client setup, and third-party configurations
- `convex/` — Convex schema, queries, mutations, actions, and scheduled functions
- `public/` — Static assets

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — Start dev server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build` — Build for production
- `pnpm lint` — Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` — Format all files with Prettier
- `pnpm typecheck` — Run TypeScript type checking with no emit

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is on — no `any` types, ever
- Prefer `type` over `interface` unless declaration merging is needed
- All Convex query/mutation arguments and return types must be explicitly typed

### Components

- Use server components by default; add `"use client"` only when the component requires browser APIs, event handlers, or React state
- **Do not pre-create components speculatively.** Create a component only when it is needed. If a component is used in one place, keep it in the same file as its parent — do not extract it into its own file until it is reused in a second place
- Functional components only — no class components
- Props types defined in the same file as the component, not in a separate types file

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for all styling — no custom CSS files, no inline `style` props
- **All shadcn components must use the dark theme** — never render shadcn components on a light background
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- Responsive design using Tailwind breakpoint prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)

### shadcn

- Install new shadcn components with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` — never hand-write shadcn primitives
- shadcn primitives live in `app/ui/` — feature components that compose them live in `components/`
- Always pass the `dark` class context when using shadcn components inside a page

### Hooks and Side Effects

- **Do not use `useEffect` unless there is no alternative.** Before reaching for `useEffect`, consider: can this be derived state? Can this be a server component? Can Convex's real-time subscriptions handle this?
- Legitimate `useEffect` uses: integrating non-React third-party libraries (e.g., WebRTC, Canvas APIs), subscribing to browser events (resize, visibility change), cleanup of imperative resources
- Never use `useEffect` for data fetching — use Convex `useQuery` or TanStack Query instead
- Never use `useEffect` to sync state from props — derive it or lift it

### Convex

- Queries must be pure — no side effects in `query()` functions
- Use `mutation()` for all writes; never write to the database from a `query()`
- Use `action()` only for calls to external APIs (Cloudflare, Restream, Web Push)
- Scheduled functions (via `ctx.scheduler`) for fan-out operations like go-live notifications
- All Convex function files live in `convex/` — one file per domain (e.g., `convex/streams.ts`, `convex/chat.ts`)
- **Convex handles all real-time subscriptions** — never use TanStack Query to poll Convex data

### TanStack Query

TanStack Query is used **only for external REST API calls** (Cloudflare Stream API, Restream API, Web Push, etc.). It is not a replacement for Convex — they serve different purposes:

- **Convex `useQuery`** — real-time database subscriptions (chat, viewer count, notifications, stream status)
- **TanStack Query `useQuery`** — one-shot or periodically refreshed calls to external HTTP APIs

#### Key rules

- Wrap the app in `QueryClientProvider` at the root layout (client component)
- Define query keys as typed constants co-located with the query function, not inline
- Always provide a `staleTime` — never rely on the default (0ms); most external API data can be stale for at least 30 seconds
- Use `useMutation` from TanStack Query for external API writes (e.g., creating a Restream broadcast session); use Convex `mutation()` for database writes
- Do not use `queryClient.invalidateQueries` to invalidate Convex data — Convex handles its own invalidation via subscriptions
- Handle `isLoading`, `isError`, and `data` states explicitly in every component that uses `useQuery`
- Place query functions in `lib/queries/` — named after the external service (e.g., `lib/queries/restream.ts`, `lib/queries/cloudflare-stream.ts`)

#### Example pattern

```ts
// lib/queries/restream.ts
export const restreamKeys = {
  sessionStatus: (sessionId: string) => ["restream", "session", sessionId] as const,
}

export async function fetchSessionStatus(sessionId: string): Promise<RestreamSessionStatus> {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/restream/session/${sessionId}`)
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch session status")
  return res.json()
}

// In a component
const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: restreamKeys.sessionStatus(sessionId),
  queryFn: () => fetchSessionStatus(sessionId),
  staleTime: 30_000,
  refetchInterval: 10_000, // poll while live
})
```

### File Naming

- Files and directories: `kebab-case` (e.g., `stream-studio.tsx`, `use-webrtc.ts`)
- Convex function files: `kebab-case` matching their domain (e.g., `convex/chat-messages.ts`)
- Component files: `kebab-case` (e.g., `studio-canvas.tsx`)
- TanStack Query files: `lib/queries/<service-name>.ts`

### Error & Loading States

- Every data-fetching component must handle loading and error states explicitly — no bare renders assuming data is available
- Convex `useQuery`: check for `undefined` (loading) before rendering data
- TanStack Query `useQuery`: check `isLoading` and `isError` before rendering `data`

## Key Architecture Notes

- **The platform always receives the stream.** A creator cannot simulcast to external platforms without also being live on Switched. The Cloudflare Stream HLS URL is always the primary delivery mechanism.
- **Guest invite links do not require an account.** Guests join via `/studio/join/[token]` — they are session-scoped participants, not platform users.
- **Tips are fake points in Phase 1.** The `tipTransactions` schema includes nullable `solanaSignature` and `tokenMint` fields from day one to make the Phase 3 Solana migration additive, not a rewrite.
- **Private backstage chat is scoped to `studioSessionId`, not `streamId`.** Never query backstage messages using the public stream chat query.
- **TanStack Query is not a Convex replacement.** Use Convex for anything that lives in the database. Use TanStack Query only for external service calls that do not go through Convex.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

<!-- convex-ai-start -->
This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
